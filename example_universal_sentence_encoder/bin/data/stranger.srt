1
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,400
The Stranger

2
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:18,960
COMMISSION OF INQUIRY
ON WAR CRIMES

3
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,160
Leave the door open.
It's simple, let him escape!

4
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,120
This is quite irregular.

5
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,920
The repercussions could be
embarrassing.

6
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,680
This is a huge responsibility.

7
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,200
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilson, but...

8
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,920
Enough talk. It makes me sick!

9
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,480
Stop weighing the repercussions
and responsibilities.

10
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,320
If I fail,
I will be the one responsible.

11
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,200
Leave the door open,
let him escape...

12
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
This is our only chance.

13
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,760
Threaten me with all the fires of hell,
I maintain this position!

14
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,720
This trash must be destroyed!

15
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,560
Can you hear me?
Destroyed.

16
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,240
To all passengers:
Disembark immediately!

17
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,160
I am travelling for health reasons.

18
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,160
Get your passports ready.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,800
I am traveling for health reasons.

20
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,760
I don't understand it.

21
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,920
The reason for your stay, Seniora?

22
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,680
I'm joining my husband.

23
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,360
Stephan Polanski.

24
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,000
What are you doing here?

25
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,240
What are you doing here?

26
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,320
I am traveling for health reasons.

27
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,840
What country are you from?

28
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,600
Poland.

29
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,920
Hotel el National... 7702.

30
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,520
You have not lost it?
Are you sure you know where it goes?

31
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,040
My wife is following him, he went
to the photographer's.

32
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,720
Probably to get a new
passport... and instructions.

33
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,560
I want to know where Frantz Kindler is.

34
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,160
There is no Frantz Kindler.

35
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,560
Frantz Kindler is dead and buried.

36
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,240
That's an order!

37
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,840
I have a message for Frantz Kindler.

38
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,400
From the almighty.

39
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,360
But it's forbidden.

40
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,520
I order you, in the name
of this authority.

41
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,520
Do you know his new name?

42
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,560
Connecticut.

43
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,160
This is in the United States.

44
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,480
The town of Harper.

45
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,760
Harper!

46
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,680
Excuse me.

47
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,200
- Good trip?
- Yes, thank you.

48
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,680
- Funny story... 
- Potter?

49
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,440
That's me.
And you can find everything here.

50
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,880
Can I leave this suitcase here?

51
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,000
The luggage is not our responsibility.
responsibility.

52
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,520
Put it on the shelf,
you can take it back whenever you want.

53
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,200
What's the best hotel in town?

54
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,320
Go to the end of the street,
at Miss Peabody's.

55
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,240
It's that way, sir.

56
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,360
BOYS' SCHOOL

57
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,040
Can I come in?

58
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,440
Yes, of course.

59
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,880
Does Mr. Charlie Rankin live here?

60
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,520
Yes, but he's not here.

61
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,400
Are you waiting for him?

62
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,080
- Yes, in a few minutes.
- Will it take long?

63
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,800
A few minutes.

64
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,880
Can I wait here?

65
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,120
Yes, if you like.

66
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
Take a seat.

67
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,880
Are you a friend of Mr. Rankin?

68
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,560
Yes, a friend.

69
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,440
My name is Mary Longstreet.

70
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,400
He should be here any minute.

71
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,880
Sometimes he stays after school,
but not today.

72
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,880
It's our wedding day.

73
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,280
Are you getting married?

74
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,760
Yes, at 6 o'clock.

75
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,360
I know, it's not conventional,
but...

76
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,560
I wanted to put up these curtains.

77
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,280
Which way is he coming?

78
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,320
Through Webster Hall. This is the building
you see there.

79
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,960
What's your name?

80
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,200
Frantz!

81
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,720
- It's me Frantz!
- Meinike!

82
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,160
We shouldn't be seen together.

83
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,160
Go back to the woods.

84
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,320
Follow the path, I'll join you.

85
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,520
Hello, Professor Rankin!

86
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,320
- What are you doing?
- A treasure hunt.

87
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,160
I'm the scout.

88
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,360
Come on, it's ideal to lose
weight.

89
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,000
Come with us.

90
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
- Where?
- In the woods.

91
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,640
I'd like to but...

92
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,000
I have a lot of things to do.

93
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,800
Come later, we'll be back
at nightfall.

94
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,320
See you later.

95
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,640
They hanged the others,
but not me.

96
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,080
This man is no match for you.

97
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,920
You haven't changed much.

98
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,440
In your uniform...
you would look almost the same.

99
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,560
Frantz, I'm not the same anymore.

100
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,600
I'm not the same either.

101
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,280
I've changed a lot, Conrad.

102
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,880
I destroyed in Germany and Poland
all evidence of my identity.

103
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Guess what I'm doing tonight at 6 o'clock?

104
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,160
Standing in front of a priest,
a woman at my side...

105
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,760
the daughter of a US Supreme Court
the daughter of a US Supreme Court Justice.

106
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,200
The girl is very pretty.
The camouflage is perfect.

107
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,720
Who would suspect that I am
the famous Frantz Kindler?

108
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,520
Teacher of the children of America,

109
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,000
so I'm hiding...

110
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,120
until the day we strike
again.

111
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,080
Would there be another war?

112
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,840
Of course there is.

113
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,800
War is an abomination.

114
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,000
That's why I'm here.

115
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,800
He released me so that 
I could come and...

116
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,080
Who freed you?

117
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,240
The Almighty.

118
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
-You mean...
- God!

119
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,480
Frantz, I'm a new man.

120
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,000
You, religious!

121
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,400
Frantz, all the doors 
were open! All of them!

122
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,760
It was a miracle!

123
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,520
They set you free so that
to lead them to me.

124
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Were you followed?

125
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
Up to here?

126
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,680
- Who followed you?
- The devil!

127
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,560
He looks like any other man.

128
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,360
He dresses like us.
He even smokes a pipe!

129
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,240
But I still recognized him.

130
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,680
And I killed him.

131
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,800
I hit him...he died...

132
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,520
It had to be done.

133
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,480
Did you kill the man with the pipe?

134
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,120
The one who was following you?

135
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,400
Didn't anyone else follow you?

136
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,000
Think of your salvation!

137
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,440
Repent!

138
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,080
Proclaim your fault...

139
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
and you will be saved.

140
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,160
Are you really sure?

141
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,880
Only God can give you the strength.

142
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,680
Come my friend,
let's pray to God...

143
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,440
to give you courage.

144
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,760
I have offended my God.

145
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,080
I am not worthy of you.

146
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,640
Repeat after me...

147
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,040
I regret having sinned...

148
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,760
I regret having sinned.

149
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,000
God of mercy...

150
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,360
How could I have offended you?

151
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,520
This way, guys!
Don't let him get away!

152
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,640
This way, guys!

153
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,640
We are gathered in the presence
of God and his faithful...

154
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,840
to unite this man and this woman
by the sacred bonds of marriage.

155
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,120
And to be faithful to him for life?

156
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,760
I want to.

157
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,080
Will you take this man
for your husband?

158
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,720
I do.

159
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,720
A wedding?

160
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,520
She is the daughter of Judge Longstreet,
he sits on the Supreme Court.

161
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,760
A tube of aspirin, please.

162
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,080
It's over there on the third shelf.

163
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,840
The cheapest one is on the left.

164
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,080
You have to serve yourself, sir.

165
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,240
There's everything you need on the shelf.

166
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
Take a look around and help yourself.

167
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,080
Are you at Miss Peabody's?

168
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,680
Just for a few days.

169
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,520
A coffee please.

170
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,920
Shall I help myself?

171
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,000
The coffee pot is behind the bar.
That's right, it's self-service!

172
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,280
What about the cream?

173
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,720
Here we drink it black.

174
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,760
This is the one on the right.

175
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,880
- Who is the groom?
- A school teacher.

176
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,120
A stranger.

177
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,920
I have published the banns.

178
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,400
I am a deputy mayor.

179
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,480
A game of checkers?

180
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,720
Deputy mayor?

181
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,040
Quite a responsibility!

182
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,000
I run the city.

183
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,360
We usually play for... 15... 20...

184
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,840
It's more like 25 cents a game.

185
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,760
It's expensive per point, but...

186
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,480
lose a little more or a little less...

187
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,120
Shall I start?

188
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,640
You must know
almost everyone here?

189
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,080
I know everyone!

190
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,760
Are you here on business?

191
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,360
Are you teaching?

192
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,400
Salesman?

193
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,080
Buyer ?

194
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,840
Antique dealer

195
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,600
They all come to Harper.

196
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,600
The judge has a nice collection.

197
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,200
- It's hopeless.
- He must not be a seller.

198
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,520
Do you have any other buyers coming in?

199
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,320
There's the guy from this morning.

200
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,400
He was on the bus with you.

201
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,160
He didn't come back for his suitcase.

202
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,160
Maybe it's one of them?

203
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,320
He looked more like a missionary.

204
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,240
He looked in the boot.

205
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,440
A little guy...

206
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,200
he looked finished and miserable.

207
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,960
- Did you hit your head?
- No big deal.

208
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,280
That's bad luck!

209
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,480
In this game, you can't lose your concentration.

210
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,440
25 cents, please.

211
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,440
I'm so disappointed...

212
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,560
Father...

213
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,680
Has anyone seen my husband?

214
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,080
Already abandoned?

215
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,400
Looks like it to me.

216
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,120
Red, have you seen Charles?

217
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,760
Come on, go get Charles.

218
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,440
He is nowhere to be found!

219
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,800
It's starting to get worrying.

220
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,800
Why, darling?

221
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,680
Have you changed?

222
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,920
Isn't it better...

223
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,480
to go on a honeymoon?

224
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,400
Give me five minutes.

225
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,360
Arrived in Harper
in the last 12 months.

226
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,760
Hello, up there.

227
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,040
Are you the one fixing the clock?

228
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,360
No, I'm cleaning it.

229
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,120
Very nice piece!

230
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,600
- My name is Wilson.
- Noah Longstreet.

231
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,280
I'm not sure, but...

232
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,960
I would say that it dates from 
end of the 16th century.

233
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,440
Probably by Kober from Strasbourg...
the clock!

234
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,560
My brother-in-law will fix it.

235
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,480
Is he up there?

236
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,080
He is on his honeymoon.
He'll take care of it when he gets back.

237
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,000
Is he an expert?

238
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,920
Yes, but it's more like 
his great passion.

239
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,800
Really! That's what I do too.

240
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,720
Honeymoon?

241
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,400
Yes, with my sister.

242
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,440
He has to go back on Friday
for the exams.

243
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,600
He is a teacher at the school.

244
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,640
His name is Rankin.

245
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,880
It's nice to show it
to a professional.

246
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,880
But my specialty is pewter.

247
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:05,240
It's good "Rivere",
the shape is a bit heavy.

248
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,360
But it's a superb work of art,
it's beautiful!

249
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,400
Mr. Wilson, my daughter Mary.

250
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,200
My son-in-law, Charles Rankin.

251
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,800
I wouldn't want to impose.

252
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,760
We are married now.

253
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,920
- Jeff, how are you?
- Good, you look good.

254
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,320
Sarah!

255
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,000
- It's going to get cold!
- To the table, gentlemen!

256
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,280
- How was the mountain?
- It was wonderful!

257
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,640
Mr. Wilson, sit on my right.

258
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,400
Jeff, in your usual place.

259
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,160
Charles is skiing like a champ!
I do too, don't I?

260
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
- Very, yes!
- For a beginner!

261
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,720
Did you tighten your knees?

262
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,560
Mr. Wilson makes a catalog
of Revere's works.

263
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,760
Mr. Wilson is an expert on clocks.

264
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,160
- But this is Charles' hobby!
- Your brother told me.

265
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,320
Are you going to fix the one in the church?

266
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,600
I might try.

267
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,920
Is it a challenge?

268
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,320
I hope he fails.

269
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,360
I like it like this,
even if it doesn't work.

270
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,640
How long have you been here?

271
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,760
Since... last Friday.

272
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,960
I treated you on Friday.

273
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,800
- How is your head?
- Much better thanks to you.

274
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,040
You hurt yourself on Thursday,
the day of the wedding!

275
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,360
Yes, that's right!...
I arrived on Thursday.

276
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,360
Are you hurt?

277
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,000
Nothing serious.

278
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,440
Enough to get a bump
big as an egg!

279
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,920
Damn door!

280
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,560
Your dog was very unhappy.

281
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,080
Here Red, to console you.

282
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,840
What about this meeting, Adam?

283
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,000
Irritating association!

284
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,720
- I read the report...
- Edifying, isn't it?

285
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,240
It's all a bunch of bullshit!

286
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,480
That's the way we talked in 1930, Noah.

287
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,160
Edifying!

288
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,560
This Times reporter in Berlin...

289
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,520
Of course he refers to rumors...

290
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,800
training of men,
underground meetings...

291
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,520
pagan rituals.

292
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,720
And you believe in that?

293
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,400
Everything is possible.

294
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,600
Sorry, but I think it's ridiculous.

295
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,880
They must be fanatics...

296
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,280
the majority of Germans
want peace.

297
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,040
You know Germany, 
Mr. Rankin?

298
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,800
I'm sorry...

299
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,600
but I'm making enemies...

300
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,560
when I bring up the subject.

301
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,360
We would like the objective opinion
of an objective historian.

302
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,280
Only a psychiatrist is competent.

303
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,040
The Germans think they are
the innocent victims...

304
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,440
of a jealous world plotting
against them...

305
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,800
and led by nations
of inferior beings.

306
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,320
They will not admit their mistake...

307
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:17,920
It's the Germans!

308
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,640
We ignored Ethiopia
and Spain...

309
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,040
but we counted our dead
and realized what the war was.

310
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,160
Everywhere men 
knew for whom the bell tolls.

311
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,840
Except in Germany!

312
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,080
The gods of war 
accompanied them in their quest...

313
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,320
eyes fixed on the sword of Sigfried.

314
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,320
It's one of those secret meetings...

315
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,160
that the German dream
will come back to life...

316
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,280
when it will be placed, sparkling...

317
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,080
under the banner of the
knights.

318
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,880
Men are waiting for 
the Messiah, but for the Germans,

319
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,400
the Messiah is not the prince of peace.

320
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,800
It's another Redbeard!

321
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,640
Another Hitler.

322
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,480
So you don't believe in the reforms
that have been taken in Germany?

323
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,360
I don't know...

324
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,800
can we change the mentality
by reforms?

325
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,360
The principles of equality and freedom
are not part of Germany.

326
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,000
All men aspire to freedom.

327
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,160
All men are born equal.

328
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,840
Liberty, equality, fraternity...

329
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,800
in Germany...

330
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,680
There is Marx!
The proletarian world has nothing to lose.

331
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,760
But Marx was not German,
he was a Jew.

332
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,400
But then, there's no solution!

333
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,600
Maybe there is.

334
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,320
Which one?

335
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,400
The annihilation...

336
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,520
the total annihilation!

337
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,120
I can't believe you're advocating
a Carthaginian peace.

338
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,240
Do I have to remind you...

339
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,360
that in Carthage, this regime has been
proven itself for 2000 years!

340
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,880
This is the answer of a pedagogue.

341
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,040
About teachers...

342
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,480
they're coming for tea on Tuesday,
do you want to come?

343
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,520
I'd love to, but...
my work is done here.

344
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,000
I'm leaving tomorrow.

345
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,200
Extraordinary this common passion
passion for clocks!

346
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,880
So Red, you like it here.

347
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,200
You bet!
Come on, let's go for a walk.

348
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,040
Honey, leave the door open,
he won't run away.

349
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,920
I need to walk,
I'm feeling feverish.

350
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,800
I will be in Washington
tomorrow afternoon.

351
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,360
You were right about Rankin.

352
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,320
He's above suspicion.

353
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,960
Pass me the inter...
I'd like Washington.

354
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,240
Only a Nazi can say that Marx
was not German, but Jewish!

355
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,120
I'll stay a little longer.

356
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,840
What's going on?

357
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:23,440
I was dreaming... about the little man.

358
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,640
What little man?

359
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,640
You know... I told you about it.

360
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,840
The one who came
on our wedding day.

361
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,360
Light me a cigarette.

362
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,640
What a strange dream!

363
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,200
He scared me!

364
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,840
The little man was walking alone...

365
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,600
in the deserted streets of the city.

366
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,440
When he moved,
there was a shadow.

367
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,240
But when he left...

368
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,480
his shadow stayed behind him,
spread out like a carpet.

369
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,680
What does this mean?

370
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,320
You are exhausted.

371
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,760
Yes, maybe.

372
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,880
Do you want to turn it off?

373
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,680
What's going on?

374
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,720
It looks like Red.

375
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,960
- What's wrong with him?
- I locked him in the basement.

376
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,720
Darling, what's wrong with you?

377
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,840
It's a dog that's never been 
been locked up.

378
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,600
I had to.

379
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,800
Tonight he will sleep in the cellar.

380
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,520
He'll have plenty of time to play around
during the day.

381
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,480
Charles I don't understand 
why you are holding him prisoner!

382
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,760
That's my dog!

383
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,120
Please Mary.

384
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,560
Is it biting around here?

385
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,520
Not bad. Would you like that?

386
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,720
I'm not equipped,
but it doesn't change anything for fishing.

387
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,000
I'm having bad luck today.

388
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,440
- Would you like some chocolate?
- I'd love some.

389
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,120
Does the whole family like fishing?

390
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,760
Dad is very good.
He's never lost a fish.

391
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,720
And Charles?

392
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,360
I call him Mr. Rankin in class.
I'm still mixing it up a bit.

393
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,960
He'd rather deal with the clock.

394
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,840
Why don't you like it?

395
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,720
How come?

396
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,560
You don't like your brother-in-law...

397
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,160
It's none of my business,
but I'd like to know why?

398
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,240
I kind of like it.

399
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,000
I don't see why...

400
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,080
I know I'm exaggerating, but...

401
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,200
I can't help it.

402
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,800
It's my job.

403
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,320
I hate to drag you into this but...

404
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,640
you're the only one I trust.

405
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,080
I need your help.

406
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,560
What do you need help with?

407
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,720
Your sister might be in danger.

408
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,200
You are an adult and can help her.

409
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm not really
an antique dealer...

410
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,200
but more like a detective.

411
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,440
What should I do, Mr. Wilson?

412
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,880
I would like Charles' schedule 
on his wedding day...

413
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,440
until the ceremony.

414
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,080
It is possible...

415
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,920
if Charles doesn't suspect anything...

416
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,320
I'll take care of him.

417
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,040
You must be mistaken.

418
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,720
Mary couldn't possibly like this kind of...
kind of person.

419
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,240
I hope I'm wrong, but...

420
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,800
everyone knows
that love is blind.

421
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,160
Mr. Rankin has fixed the clock.

422
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,200
Does it tell the right time?

423
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,240
And does the angel go around the bell tower?

424
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,360
What is the sex of the angel, Mr. Wilson?

425
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,320
I don't know.

426
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,040
Mind you, this is not important.

427
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,720
Do you give up?

428
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,760
Not at all, here's your 25 cents.

429
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,840
By the way, has Mr. Rankin stopped by
to get his supper?

430
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,640
He's been upstairs for an hour.

431
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,400
Yes, I know.

432
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,120
The days are getting shorter.

433
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,920
The man with the suitcase didn't show up again?

434
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,120
Strange.

435
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,760
I was tempted to look
inside.

436
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,080
It's not closed.

437
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,480
In this case,
you are entitled to do so.

438
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,320
- I won't open it without a witness.
- I'm here...

439
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,440
Dirty laundry, sweater, soap and razor...

440
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,480
wrapped in a towel marked:
SS Cristobel.

441
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,920
A pair of old shoes...

442
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,160
and religious pamphlets.

443
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,240
Mr. Potter and I have been looking
through this guy's stuff...

444
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,200
who left his suitcase and never picked it up.

445
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,520
It's been over two weeks.

446
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,000
Do you know what he was coming to do?

447
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,920
He looked in the phone book and that was it.

448
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,680
He looked funny...

449
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,760
a strange look
and big blue eyes...

450
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,840
and a singular walk.

451
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,000
He looked like he was running away.

452
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,360
Did he have a foreign accent?

453
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,840
Yes, he did.

454
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,480
It wasn't so much the accent,
but the way he spoke.

455
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,320
Would you know what happened to
Mrs. Rankin?

456
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,920
But no... why?

457
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,800
I was just trying to solve
this mystery.

458
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,520
Don't all foreigners have 
an accent?

459
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,000
Mary, have you seen Red?

460
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,080
Not in two days.

461
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,400
He runs around the woods
and he doesn't even come to eat.

462
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,800
- He wasn't running away?
- Not until then.

463
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,960
That's very worrying.

464
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,640
Let's go home, honey.

465
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,040
Have you got anything new?

466
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,680
Your sister met Meinike
at her house.

467
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,400
Did Mary say so?

468
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,960
She was starting to do it.

469
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,480
She's a good girl.

470
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,840
She must know who her husband is.

471
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,440
You don't know Mary.
She won't want to hear it.

472
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,040
She'll find out for herself.

473
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,440
Do you understand?

474
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,040
She doesn't know anything yet...

475
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,720
except that she must be hiding from us
that she met Meinike.

476
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,000
I would like to know
the explanation he's going to give her.

477
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,160
I was a student in Geneva...

478
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,720
there was a girl...

479
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,120
the day before I left,
we went to the lake.

480
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,600
She would kill herself if I didn't marry her.

481
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,640
I thought it was a joke.

482
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,080
Of course, I was wrong...

483
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,680
I didn't react, she got up and...

484
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,920
I dove in behind her, but...

485
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,560
it was already too late.

486
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,600
Only his brother knew
that we were by the lake...

487
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:46,000
he knew that I didn't kill her 
killed her, but...

488
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,880
he blackmailed me.

489
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,080
I paid and left Switzerland.

490
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,920
I hoped he was dead.

491
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,280
But on our wedding day,
he came back.

492
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,120
Her brother and Meinike
are the same man.

493
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,400
I gave him everything I had
I had...

494
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,240
and he left.

495
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,440
You should have told me...

496
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,560
not to keep this horrible
story to yourself.

497
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,160
You are a wonderful woman, Mary,
I love you.

498
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,160
Why didn't he take over
his business?

499
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,960
I guess with money,
he could afford better.

500
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,640
Honey, I'm extremely nervous!

501
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,920
I'm going to work on the clock.

502
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,080
Alone. It will calm me down.

503
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,680
You understand me, don't you?

504
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,280
Shall I take you home?

505
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,640
You don't have to.

506
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,120
It's late.

507
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,160
There's nothing to worry about here in Harper.

508
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,400
My poor Red!

509
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,680
He must have heard me whistle.

510
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,080
He couldn't bark.

511
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,400
He crawled to here,
before he died.

512
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,840
What did he die of?

513
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,600
Come on, let's find out.

514
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,760
This is Red, the Longstreet dog.

515
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,480
He looks dead!

516
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,760
They take him to 
Dr. Lauwrence.

517
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,920
What could have happened to him?

518
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,400
A game of checkers?

519
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,000
You owe me money.

520
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,440
How long does it take
does the poison work?

521
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,920
Not more than a minute or two.

522
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,920
Red must have been poisoned
not far from where you found him.

523
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,160
Assessing the distance...

524
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,880
he had to move more and more
slowly.

525
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,840
Thank you very much.

526
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,880
Mr. Peabody, would you please bring in
these magazines?

527
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,720
What's the law on this kind of
of murder?

528
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,520
It's the same thing
as killing a man.

529
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,760
It's also ugly!

530
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,880
Four muddy legs...

531
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,520
no mud anywhere else.

532
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,800
Dry leaves with mud...

533
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,720
Red must have dug somewhere
in the woods.

534
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,880
And what for?

535
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,200
For a corpse, I think!

536
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,800
Meinike's.

537
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,120
The little guy?

538
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:29,920
I was just leaving.

539
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,480
- Any problems?
- No, I'm closing because of the search.

540
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,000
- What can I get you?
- Oil... What search?

541
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,360
For the corpse.

542
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,560
The police have searched half the city.

543
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,040
Now that's parochial news!

544
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,080
Which corpse is it?

545
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,480
The man with the suitcase, I bet.

546
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,400
Curious little man!

547
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,960
A poor bastard!

548
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,200
It was supposed to end badly!

549
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,520
15 cents for the oil.

550
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,040
I'll put that on your account.

551
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,800
Sarah told me you were here.

552
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,600
What's with the luggage?

553
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,200
Are we going somewhere?

554
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,600
Not us, honey...
Me!

555
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,680
What are you talking about?

556
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,080
Normally you leave your wife
when you don't love her anymore, but...

557
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,000
I have to leave because I love you.

558
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,120
You won't mind
when you know who I am.

559
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,160
But I married you
and that's all that matters.

560
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,760
Honey, for better or for worse.

561
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,960
Even... if I killed Red?

562
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,640
You couldn't have!

563
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,680
Was it an accident?

564
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,960
No, I wanted to kill him!

565
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:05,400
One murder leads to another
and then it's a spiral.

566
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,760
Red was scratching the grave...
of the man I killed.

567
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,080
Yes, your little man.

568
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,600
Did you kill him?

569
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,200
With these hands!

570
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,680
The same, but holding you
against me.

571
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,240
Now let me go.

572
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,440
Why did you do that?

573
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,520
I gave him everything, but
he wanted more.

574
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,200
Your father is rich.

575
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:38,840
He knew he would do anything to protect
his daughter and avoid scandal.

576
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,000
For a few thousand dollars...

577
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,240
I should have gone to the end of the world,
disappear, but...

578
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,000
I loved you!

579
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,200
I couldn't.

580
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,840
If we're going to run, we're going to run together!

581
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,560
You would do the same for me.

582
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,520
Who else knows that you knew
this man?

583
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,280
No one else.

584
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,160
You're the only one who knows.

585
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,680
Then there's nothing to fear.
No one can talk.

586
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,360
But Mary, if you don't talk...

587
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,560
you become an accomplice to murder!

588
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,200
But I'm already part of it...

589
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,040
since I belong to you.

590
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,640
You tremble when I touch you...

591
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,400
with these hands that have killed.

592
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,560
It's nervous.

593
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,000
Hold me tight, Charles!

594
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,040
Mr. Peabody, go inside with the sheriff,
open the coroner's office.

595
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,880
That's the one!

596
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,040
Of course, he's changed a bit.

597
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,800
Being buried doesn't help.

598
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,400
What do we do about Mary?
We can't leave her alone with him.

599
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:16,800
She'll realize that this so-called
story about Meinike is false.

600
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,000
I think your sister is ready
to know the truth.

601
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,120
Are they going to let me see the body?

602
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,120
I don't think so.

603
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,240
I wouldn't stand for it!

604
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,560
I've never seen a dead person... I...

605
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,440
How many will we be for tea?

606
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,440
28 in all.

607
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,320
You haven't touched the dinner.

608
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,920
It's not too much, 28
 for both of you?

609
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,280
We'll be fine.

610
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,440
- We should do...
- Do what?

611
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,040
I don't know, I'm terrified
of all these things...

612
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,800
Mary, a little bit of cold blood.

613
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:17,040
You need to know exactly what 
you need to say or do.

614
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,160
Always be natural.

615
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,840
Now listen to me, darling.

616
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,440
I'm going to turn myself in to the police.

617
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,960
It's your father, Miss Mary,
he wants to talk to you.

618
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,200
I think so.

619
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,200
Just a moment, I'll see.

620
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,360
He wants me to come and see him.

621
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,720
Me too?

622
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,920
No, just me.

623
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,120
It seems normal
for a father to want to see his daughter.

624
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,840
Okay, I'll be right there.

625
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,120
That's pretty strange!

626
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,760
Strange? No.

627
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,760
I'm going to the church to see the clock
while you are with your father.

628
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,520
You will take me back when you come back.

629
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,840
I'm so scared!

630
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,120
Why does he want to see me alone?

631
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,720
- He was not natural.
- Do you know what you have to say?

632
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,240
Is something wrong?

633
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,120
Mr. Wilson wants to talk to you.

634
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,960
Try to help him as much as you 
you can.

635
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,400
He's going to ask you some questions.

636
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,640
What do you want to know, Mr. Wilson?

637
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,800
You know that we discovered
a dead body yesterday...

638
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,720
Do you know him?

639
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,840
No, I don't.

640
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,600
Did you see the body?

641
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,920
In this case, how do you know who he is? 
how do you know who he is?

642
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,680
I can't be sure...

643
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,400
What do you suspect me of?

644
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,560
Of covering up for a murderer!

645
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,800
This picture will refresh your 
your memory.

646
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,280
Do you recognize this man?

647
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,560
That's Conrad Meinike.

648
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,000
Commander-in-Chief
of a concentration camp.

649
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,280
You know him, don't you?

650
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,600
You saw him in Harper!

651
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,880
No, I've never seen this man.

652
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,880
Judge, would you turn that off?

653
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,240
I would like you to watch
this film.

654
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:21,000
I am part of the commission that
investigates and punishes war crimes.

655
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,320
I am tracking down the Nazis
who have fled.

656
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,160
That's what brought me to Harper.

657
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,520
I mean, don't you think...

658
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,840
Mr. Wilson, I've never seen a Nazi.

659
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,120
Who knows?

660
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,960
They are like everybody else...

661
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,280
and do like everybody else.
When it suits them.

662
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,320
This is the gas chamber, Miss Rankin.

663
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,360
They were given a shower
that would dilate the pores of the skin...

664
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,560
so that the gases would act
the gases to act more quickly.

665
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,760
And here is the quicklime...

666
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,280
in which hundreds of men
women and children were burned alive.

667
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,160
Why do I have to watch
these atrocities?

668
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,080
All that you have seen...

669
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,560
is the work of the mind 
of one man.

670
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,600
His name is...

671
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,960
Frantz Kindler!

672
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,120
The most brilliant mind of the Nazi party.

673
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:35,720
Kindler created genocide...
for the populations of the defeated countries.

674
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,160
Germany wanted to become the greatest
nation in Western Europe.

675
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,600
Biologically speaking...

676
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,360
unlike Goebbels, Himmler
and the others...

677
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,440
Kindler had a passion
of anonymity.

678
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,800
The newspapers don't have any pictures
of him.

679
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,600
Before he disappeared...

680
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,000
he destroyed all tracks
linking him to his past.

681
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,120
Even his fingerprints.

682
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,560
There is no evidence of the identity
of Frantz Kindler.

683
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,320
Except for one small thing!

684
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,840
He has a hobby
that is a real passion...

685
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,560
clocks!

686
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,800
There are others...

687
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,520
You're the first one!

688
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,840
It's not over yet.

689
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,840
In prison, in Czechoslovakia...

690
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,320
a war criminal
was waiting for his execution...

691
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:25,240
Mr. Conrad Meinike,
executive officer of Frantz Kindler.

692
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,480
A monstrous piece of trash!

693
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,520
He reeked of burning flesh
on his clothes.

694
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,200
But we let him go, hoping that he would 
hoping that he would lead us to Kindler.

695
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,960
He led me here...

696
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,280
and I lost it.

697
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,800
Until yesterday!

698
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,720
Your dog found it for me.

699
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:49,080
Unfortunately, dead and buried.

700
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,000
Now there is only one person left in the world
only one person left...

701
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,600
who can identify Frantz Kindler...

702
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,840
the one who knows...

703
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,240
formally, that Meinike
came to Harper to see him.

704
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,080
No, that's impossible!

705
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,120
Charles is not a nazi!

706
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,760
You were at Rankin's house the day...

707
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,080
- Did anyone come by?
- I don't remember.

708
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,320
Try it, it's been two weeks.

709
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,560
- No one came.
- Were you alone?

710
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:30,960
Who else was there?

711
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,680
Charles, he came after his classes.

712
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,840
He stayed for more than an hour.

713
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,720
There is no evidence that my husband
is Kindler.

714
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,200
It's just a ridiculous suspicion
ridiculous suspicions.

715
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,160
You want me to involve him 
in this story?

716
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,120
You should know this...

717
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,320
that it's all lies!

718
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,080
Lies... lies!

719
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:42,120
You know that your happiness and Noah's
is more important to me than anything else.

720
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,280
Let's take an honest look
the situation.

721
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,320
Your happiness may depend
on the truth.

722
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,720
If Mr. Wilson is right,
 you have innocently married a criminal.

723
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,640
Then the marriage is void!

724
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,320
The loyalty of a wife
is not punishable.

725
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,200
It is good!

726
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,720
He wouldn't hurt anyone except...

727
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,040
to protect someone he loves.

728
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,240
Then we'll talk to him.

729
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,920
Charles was not with you
that afternoon.

730
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,440
You told me that yourself.

731
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,000
You too, Adam!

732
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,840
You never loved him!

733
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:38,240
He's not a Nazi!
Leave us in peace!

734
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,760
She knows the truth.

735
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,360
But she won't accept it.

736
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,280
It's so horrible!

737
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:57,280
What she can't accept...

738
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,280
is that she could give
her love to such a monster.

739
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,960
But we have an ally!
Her subconscious.

740
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:09,040
He knows the truth, he will fight for it.

741
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:13,560
The desire for truth in your daughter
will prevail.

742
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,400
If he is not Charles Rankin,
we should be able to prove it easily.

743
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,040
Let him not be Charles Rankin,
I don't care!

744
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,320
What you have to prove,
is that he is Frantz Kindler.

745
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,840
What are you going to do?

746
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,800
For your daughter...

747
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,800
I think she's going to have
a breakdown.

748
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,440
Logical result of the conflict
that haunts her.

749
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,720
- Rankin is going to find out.
- So what?

750
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:46,200
He won't be able to trust her anymore.
He will have to act.

751
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:50,520
He may run away.
This does not prove his guilt.

752
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,760
Or else...

753
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,160
- Keep going!
- He'll kill her!

754
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,320
I understand that you are shocked,
you are her father.

755
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,840
That's why I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you frankly.

756
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,800
Of course, we'll try
to prevent this crime.

757
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:17,680
However, an attempted murder
would be the best possible evidence.

758
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,000
Listen...It works! 
after a hundred years!

759
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,760
It was a trap!

760
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,200
Mr. Wilson was there.
He claimed you were a Nazi...

761
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,720
and that I should believe him!

762
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:57,960
He is very clever!
He wanted to terrorize me with that corpse.

763
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,400
Who does he think I am?

764
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,120
A Nazi! Frantz Kindler!

765
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,400
They tried to trap me...

766
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:10,360
but I didn't say anything.
They couldn't believe it!

767
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,560
Will you be able to prove
that you're not... a Nazi?

768
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:18,600
We'll find someone who was with you.
If you're right, there's nothing he can do.

769
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:24,400
There is no danger...
if you don't talk.

770
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,400
Of course not!

771
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:29,240
Even under torture,
I wouldn't talk!

772
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,560
The chimes have woken up all of Harper.

773
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,120
We have to go down to greet them.

774
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,560
Let's look natural.

775
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,320
You have to smile.
Will that do?

776
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,760
Let's go downstairs, honey.

777
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,360
The chime rings
and the angel took flight again...

778
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,520
Professor, I take my hat off to you.

779
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,960
Congratulations, Mr. Rankin!

780
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,480
The rector will be delighted!

781
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,000
We'll make it, honey.

782
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:18,000
Your roosters will crow every quarter
every quarter of an hour tonight!

783
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,440
Sarah, I told you to draw the curtains!

784
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:37,280
I don't want sunlight, it spoils them.

785
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,480
That's ridiculous and you know it.
In my father's house you didn't do that.

786
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,000
This is my house,
I want them pulled!

787
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,840
As you wish.

788
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,760
Are you ready for the reception?

789
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,360
It's already time.

790
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,160
Did you open the grave?
Was it horrible?

791
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:04,920
Quite unpleasant!

792
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,920
Another modern prescription!

793
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,720
Sleeping pills are not good!

794
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,520
A dollar 65.
Shall I wrap them up?

795
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,920
Don't overdo it!

796
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,320
A man who does his job
sleeps well at night.

797
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:23,240
It's because of the clock!

798
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,320
My wife ordered an ice cream.

799
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:30,720
Someone who was going to your house
took it away.

800
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,840
Mr. Wilson.

801
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,200
I never go out alone anymore.

802
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,840
The murderer is still at large...

803
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,480
I hope you haven't
forgot to invite me.

804
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,880
Of course I didn't.

805
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,080
Mr. Potter gave me this for you.

806
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,800
The ice cream, Sarah is waiting for it.
I hope it hasn't melted!

807
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,040
I'm not holding you back any longer.

808
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,480
Would you like a drink?

809
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,480
- Do you know Dr. Hippard?
- Sure, how are you?

810
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,520
Grandma, do you want anything?

811
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,400
Nothing, I have everything I need.

812
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,920
- Where is Rankin?
- He'll be here any minute.

813
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,760
His work on the clock
is remarkable.

814
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,120
What was the name of this Frenchman?

815
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,680
Landru!

816
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,760
Maybe there are other graves
in the woods...

817
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,640
What is Emerson's phrase
about this crime?

818
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,720
Please excuse my tardiness.

819
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,120
Do you know this quote
by Emerson?

820
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,000
"A crime is committed and everything freezes."

821
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:02,880
No, it doesn't.

822
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,640
A crime is committed 
and the earth is crystal.

823
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,160
A crime has been committed... I'm there!

824
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,920
The coat of the snowman
of snow on the ground...

825
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:19,280
which resounds with all the noises
of the animals in the forest.

826
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,080
We can't remember the words.

827
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,640
We can't erase
all traces.

828
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:29,640
Even if it's far from the ground,
evidence will reveal the crime.

829
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,440
Do you know that you are
our number one suspect.

830
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:41,880
We think you killed to get
to get hold of rare antiques...

831
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,600
Why did you fix the clock?
Harper was so quiet before.

832
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,120
- What is Wilson doing here?
- I don't know.

833
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:56,520
- You invited him! What is he looking for?
- I don't know.

834
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,960
- Are you feeling well?
- Yes, I'm fine.

835
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:17,280
Can I help you?

836
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:39,960
It broke,
the beads scattered on the floor.

837
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,880
They went up.

838
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:47,640
When I left,
she was still crying.

839
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,280
She's falling apart.

840
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,000
Her subconscious has almost won.

841
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,680
Now we have to watch her
very closely.

842
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,080
I always have to know where she's going.

843
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:06,240
If she doesn't tell you anything, you have to keep her
on any pretext.

844
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,160
Is that understood, Sarah?

845
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,200
By breaking her necklace,
she signed her death warrant.

846
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,200
Her life is in our hands.

847
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,920
Every time she walks
on a slippery place...

848
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:22,000
or near something
that can fall...

849
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:26,280
driving a car, anything that could result in a
could result in a fatal accident...

850
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,680
his life is in danger!

851
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,520
Not with me!

852
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:46,000
Today, we will try to finish with the
with the reign of Frederick the Great.

853
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:51,480
King of Prussia, Count of Brandenburg,
prince of Poland...

854
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,680
On the 18th... Harper.

855
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,240
Mary, it's Charles.

856
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:24,360
I can't talk any louder,
so listen carefully...

857
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,240
Something very important
has happened.

858
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,800
Come to the church immediately.

859
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,840
No one must know where you are going.

860
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:43,200
Don't tell anyone. Park your car
behind the church, near the door.

861
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,240
Put it there with the rest.

862
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,680
What's that, Mr. Peabody?

863
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,360
Are you going out?

864
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:22,680
Where are you going?

865
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,440
I ask you where are you going?

866
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:26,640
I heard you.

867
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:31,840
Sarah, I'm not a child anymore,
I'm married!

868
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,840
Not for a long time!

869
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,400
I'm in a hurry!

870
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,800
That's no reason to ignore me!

871
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,480
- What is it, Sarah?
- Well...I...

872
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,320
Tell me what's going on?

873
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,440
I don't know what's going on with you...

874
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,080
you didn't talk to me 
in that tone before.

875
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,680
I'm useless here!

876
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,840
I am old.

877
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,480
If you want me to leave...

878
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,520
This is all nonsense!

879
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,360
I'm going to pack my suitcase and leave.

880
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:17,880
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

881
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,400
I can't do without you.

882
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,560
- Is that right?
- Yes, it's true.

883
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,000
You will never leave me.

884
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,120
You know I love you...

885
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,080
like my own daughter.

886
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,760
I have to go, I promised.

887
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,200
But where?

888
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,320
That's enough, Sarah!

889
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,960
It's a secret.

890
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:04,880
What's going on?

891
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:09,280
My heart... I can't breathe! It hurts!

892
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,600
Don't move.

893
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,080
The 1-3-0 please.

894
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,760
I was supposed to join Charles  
in the bell tower, but I can't...

895
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,000
can you tell him to wait for me?

896
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:41,560
Noah, please don't tell anyone!
It's important.

897
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,080
Let me speak to Mr. Wilson.

898
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,000
Looks like it's going to snow.

899
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:34,520
It's getting late, ladies,
you are working too hard.

900
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,280
No, Mr Rankin. We closed
as usual at 3:30.

901
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:42,960
That's right.
I finished 10 minutes early.

902
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:46,360
It's 3:44.

903
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,680
I was playing checkers,
how time flies!

904
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,200
How distracted you can be!

905
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,800
This is your lucky day!

906
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,560
- I can't find them!
- What?

907
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,640
- The headbands.
- Next to the mufflers.

908
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:43,320
Can you help me?

909
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:48,440
They are in their place, in the box.

910
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,600
4:00, leave Potter
4:05 at my place.

911
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,160
Everything increases!

912
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,400
Do you take this?

913
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:04,000
You're setting a bad example for me.

914
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:07,920
I didn't want to stay that long.

915
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,120
What about my revenge?

916
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,000
It's your turn.

917
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,200
He's moved on.

918
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,760
You can still smell the glue.

919
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:25,480
Look, it's going to snow.

920
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:46,040
That's it, Professor.

921
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,080
Double or nothing?

922
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,240
Good afternoon.

923
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,240
Didn't you go to church?

924
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,120
She had like a... a stroke.

925
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,600
Jeff asked me to look after her.

926
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:10,120
- But what's going on?
- Nothing's happening...

927
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,920
Why this meeting at the church?

928
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:17,960
- You said it was important.
- Nothing is important...

929
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:23,000
I failed...
out of caution.

930
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,240
Explain yourself!

931
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,360
Excuse me.

932
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,120
I'm not feeling well.

933
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,680
I'm allowed to break down too.

934
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:42,800
I'll explain in due course.

935
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,040
Anything new?

936
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,320
Nobody will find anything, as long as...

937
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,680
I haven't left my room.

938
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:52,120
We're talking about arrest!

939
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,240
I have a headache.

940
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:56,640
The necklace episode worried me.

941
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:00,160
I thought you had talked to your father.

942
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,680
You have nothing to worry about.

943
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,360
What did you say to Noah?

944
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:13,000
About what?

945
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,640
- Did you see it?
- No, why?

946
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,400
- Did you come straight from church?
- Is this an interrogation?

947
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:23,480
I couldn't come, so I asked
Noah to let you know.

948
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,040
You didn't have to!

949
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:27,720
- Call him back right away!
- It is impossible!

950
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,720
- Call him back!
- He's gone!

951
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,600
If he dies, you will be responsible!

952
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:33,840
You have ruined everything!

953
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,120
It could have worked...

954
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,400
but you were there the day that...

955
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:44,640
And you tell Noah!

956
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:45,720
I didn't kill Noah!

957
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,760
Yes, you did, if he climbs the bell tower ladder!

958
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:54,760
You wanted to kill me!

959
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:00,280
Yes, it's you!...
Frantz Kindler!

960
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:05,800
Kill me... I want to!

961
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,120
I have nothing to live for,
now.

962
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:13,840
Kill me, but don't touch me!

963
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,240
Take this!

964
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,520
Give me the police.

965
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,040
The barricades are ready.

966
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,800
We're watching the station.
He's not in the woods.

967
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,960
- I'm going in.
- I'm going to the police.

968
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,720
Capturing him should be easy.

969
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,840
We'll try to get him alive.

970
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,520
She's gone.

971
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:12,440
She's not in the house anymore!

972
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,960
The bell tower!

973
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,040
I don't know.

974
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,120
If he's there and if she gets there before us...

975
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,360
What are we going to do?

976
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:25,520
Call the captain,
we need backup.

977
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:32,920
To the church, quickly!

978
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:08,800
Don't move! I am armed.

979
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:13,120
No need, I am alone.

980
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,080
What are you doing here?

981
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:16,960
Help me upstairs.

982
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,480
Are you telling the truth?

983
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:27,880
Why would I lie?

984
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:32,520
Were you followed?

985
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:36,280
I went through the cemetery,
nobody saw me.

986
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,200
I wanted you to let me come up here.

987
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,240
- What do you want?
- I came to kill you.

988
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,720
You are the one who is going to die!

989
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,880
You had to fall off that ladder.

990
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:15,920
You're going to fall...

991
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:20,040
I don't care if you fall with me.

992
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,720
You are stupid.

993
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,760
They searched the woods.

994
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,240
A real anthill!

995
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,320
I had to run away to be sure...

996
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:36,320
They'll know you killed me.

997
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,240
You're on the verge of a breakdown...

998
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,960
and you broke down.
Why else would you be here?

999
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,840
In an empty church, in the middle of the night!

1000
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:47,400
We will conclude to suicide...

1001
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:48,880
No need to kill her!

1002
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,480
It won't do any good.

1003
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:56,920
Look out the window!

1004
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:58,920
Look out!

1005
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,920
This is a trick! A lousy trick!

1006
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:05,520
Stuff! 
That's all you know!

1007
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:06,520
I don't need it.

1008
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,880
You won't need them anymore.

1009
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,720
You're finished, Frantz Kindler!

1010
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,280
Harper's citizens,

1011
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:28,960
they're coming to get you.

1012
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:32,360
All those you were laughing at,

1013
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,960
you won't fool them anymore!

1014
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:38,560
You can kill me and Mary
and half these people,

1015
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:39,960
but there's no way out.

1016
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,360
You were already down to Harper.

1017
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:48,600
And now this bell tower
which is closing in on you.

1018
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:53,760
Everything they say is wrong!
I obeyed the orders.

1019
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,520
You were giving them!

1020
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,200
I did my duty.

1021
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,960
Don't turn me in,
I am not a criminal!

1022
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:05,160
You are.

1023
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,000
Give me that gun!

1024
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,320
Mary is safe, Mr. Wilson,
we're going to help you.

1025
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:30,480
No, I'm all right.

1026
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,800
- What happened?
- We won.

1027
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,440
What?
You're going downstairs?

1028
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:38,160
I want a new ladder.

1029
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:40,920
Broken ankle, cracked skull...

1030
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,920
That's enough!
I'm not taking any more risks!

1031
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,720
We understand you well,
Mr. Wilson,

1032
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,760
don't worry,
you won't have any more problems.

1033
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,120
Have sweet dreams!

1034
01:30:54,120 --> 01:31:01,840
